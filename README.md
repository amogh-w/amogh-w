I am a 20 year old engineering student and developer who wants to change the world for the better with the help of technology.

I write stuff in JavaScript and Python.

I love Artificial Intelligence and the maths behind it. It's simple and complex at the same time. I plan to understand it all.

All of my projects are open sourced and well documented in my GitHub repositories. Pull requests are welcomed.

Almost everything can be done from a terminal. The Arch wiki has all the solutions to my problems.
